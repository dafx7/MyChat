# Video Chat App using Django and Agora SDK
This is a video chat app created using Django and Agora SDK. The app allows users to connect and have video calls with each other. The front end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How it Works
The app provides a simple interface where users can create an account or log in if they already have one. Once logged in, users can start a new call by clicking on the "New Call" button. The app generates a unique call link that can be shared with the person they want to call. When the other person joins the call, the video call starts and users can enjoy their conversation.

The back end of the app is built using Django and Agora SDK. Django is used for managing user authentication and providing the necessary APIs for the front end. Agora SDK is used for real-time audio and video communication between users.
